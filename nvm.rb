      Add the following to $HOME/.bashrc, $HOME/.zshrc, or your shell's
      equivalent configuration file:

        source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh

      
      Optionally, if you prefer to have NVM's working directory in your $HOME
      directory, do the following:

      Add NVM's working directory to your $HOME path (if it doesn't exist):

        mkdir ~/.nvm

      Copy nvm-exec to NVM's working directory

        cp $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm-exec ~/.nvm/

      Add the following to your shell's configuration file:

        export NVM_DIR=~/.nvm

      Type `nvm help` for further information.
